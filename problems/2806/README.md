# 2806. Account Balance After Rounded Purchase

Initially, you have a bank account balance of `100` dollars.

You are given an integer `purchaseAmount` representing the amount you will spend on a purchase in dollars, in other words, its price.

When making the purchase, first the `purchaseAmount` is rounded to the nearest multiple of `10`. Let us call this value `roundedAmount`. Then, `roundedAmount` dollars are removed from your bank account.

Return an integer denoting your final bank account balance after this purchase.

Notes:

- `0` is considered to be a multiple of `10` in this problem.
- When rounding, `5` is rounded upward (`5` is rounded to `10`, `15` is rounded to `20`, `25` to `30`, and so on).

### Example 1:

```
Input: purchaseAmount = 9
Output: 90
Explanation: The nearest multiple of 10 to 9 is 10. So your account balance becomes 100 - 10 = 90.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: purchaseAmount = 15
Output: 80
Explanation: The nearest multiple of 10 to 15 is 20. So your account balance becomes 100 - 20 = 80.
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: purchaseAmount = 10
Output: 90
Explanation: 10 is a multiple of 10 itself. So your account balance becomes 100 - 10 = 90.
```

### Constraints:

- `0 <= purchaseAmount <= 100`
