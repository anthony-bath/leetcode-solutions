# 3847. Find the Score Difference in a Game

You are given an integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` represents the points scored in the `i`th game.

There are exactly two players. Initially, the first player is active and the second player is inactive.

The following rules apply sequentially for each game `i`:

- If `nums[i]` is odd, the active and inactive players swap roles.
- In every 6th game (that is, game indices `5`, `11`, `17`, ...), the active and inactive players swap roles.
- The active player plays the `i`th game and gains `nums[i]` points.

Return the score difference, defined as the first player's total score minus the second player's total score.

### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 0
Explanation:
Game 0: Since the points are odd, the second player becomes active and gains nums[0] = 1 point.
Game 1: No swap occurs. The second player gains nums[1] = 2 points.
Game 2: Since the points are odd, the first player becomes active and gains nums[2] = 3 points.
The score difference is 3 - 3 = 0.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [2,4,2,1,2,1]
Output: 4
Explanation:
Games 0 to 2: The first player gains 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 points.
Game 3: Since the points are odd, the second player is now active and gains nums[3] = 1 point.
Game 4: The second player gains nums[4] = 2 points.
Game 5: Since the points are odd, the players swap roles. Then, because this is the 6th game, the players swap again. The second player gains nums[5] = 1 point.
The score difference is 8 - 4 = 4.
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: -1
Explanation:
Game 0: Since the points are odd, the second player is now active and gains nums[0] = 1 point.
The score difference is 0 - 1 = -1.
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
