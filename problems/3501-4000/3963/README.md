# 3963. Create Grid With Exactly One Path

You are given two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of rows and columns of a grid.

Construct any `m x n` grid consisting only of the characters `'.'` and `'#'`, where:

- `'.'` represents a free cell.
- `'#'` represents an obstacle cell.

A valid path is a sequence of free cells that:

- Starts at the top-left cell `(0, 0)`.
- Ends at the bottom-right cell `(m - 1, n - 1)`.
- Moves only:
  - Right, from `(i, j)` to `(i, j + 1)`, or
  - Down, from `(i, j)` to `(i + 1, j)`.

Return any grid such that there is exactly one valid path from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.

### Example 1:

```
Input: m = 2, n = 3
Output: ["..#","#.."]
Explanation:
The only valid path is: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2)
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: m = 3, n = 3
Output: ["..#","#..","##."]
Explanation:
The only valid path is: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2)
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: m = 1, n = 4
Output: ["...."]
Explanation:
The only valid path is: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3)
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= m, n <= 25`
