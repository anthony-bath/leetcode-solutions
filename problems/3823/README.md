# 3823. Reverse Letters Then Special Characters in a String

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters and special characters.

Your task is to perform these in order:

- Reverse the lowercase letters and place them back into the positions originally occupied by letters.
- Reverse the special characters and place them back into the positions originally occupied by special characters.

Return the resulting string after performing the reversals.

### Example 1:

```
Input: s = ")ebc#da@f("
Output: "(fad@cb#e)"
Explanation:
The letters in the string are ['e', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'a', 'f']:
Reversing them gives ['f', 'a', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'e']
s becomes ")fad#cb@e("
​​​​​​​The special characters in the string are [')', '#', '@', '(']:
Reversing them gives ['(', '@', '#', ')']
s becomes "(fad@cb#e)"
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: s = "z"
Output: "z"
Explanation:
The string contains only one letter, and reversing it does not change the string. There are no special characters.
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: s = "!@#$%^&\*()"
Output: ")(\*&^%$#@!"
Explanation:
The string contains no letters. The string contains all special characters, so reversing the special characters reverses the whole string.
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters and the special characters in `"!@#$%^&\*()"`.
